Also it has ability to fill bounded regions with simple and check board fill.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Team**\r\n* Mayank Meghwanshi (@mayank127)\r\n* Aditya Raj (@grumpy-garfield)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**color_t class**\r\n* It has Red, Green and Blue value to store color information. Integers can range from 0-255\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**pen_t class**\r\n* pen has size (int)\r\n* pen has color (color_t)\r\n* pen has eraseMode (bool)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**object_t class**\r\n* this has a pen (pen_t)\r\n* it is an abstract class for all objects which are drawn on screen\r\n* it has function like draw and print which draws inherited objects and prints info in fstream.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**point_t class**\r\n* it is inherited from object_t so it contains pen\r\n* it contains x, y (int) to store location of point to be drawn\r\n* this is the only object which directly used opengl interface to draw\r\n* its draw function also updates a bool 2d array containing boundary information like line and polygon\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**line_t class**\r\n* it is inherited from object_t so it contains pen\r\n* it contains p1, p2 (point_t) to store end points of line\r\n* it uses bresenham algorithm for all integers to draw line in all quadrants\r\n* it uses draw function of point to draw a line\r\n![Lines Sample](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~manku/Images/myDraw/lines.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**polygon_t class**\r\n* it is inherited from object_t so it contains pen\r\n* it contains a list of points (list<point_t>) to store vertices of polygon\r\n* it uses a loop to take a pair of point which initiate a line drawing using line_t\r\n![Polygons Sample](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~manku/Images/myDraw/polygons.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**fill_t class**\r\n* it is inherited from object_t so it contains pen\r\n* it contains pen1, pen2 (pen_t) to store two colors to facilitate check board fill also\r\n* it has a point (point_t) to know the start point of flood fill\r\n* it contains a boolean check to identify type of fill\r\n* it implements a flood fill algorithm for four neighbors and queue implementation\r\n![Fill Sample](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~manku/Images/myDraw/fill.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**drawing_t class**\r\n* it contains list of objects (list<object_t*>)\r\n* the list uses polymorphism concept to contain different class object as they are all inherited from object_t\r\n* it implements different addObject methods for each of the inherited class of object_t class\r\n* it has draw function to call all objects draw function and similar for print\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**canvas_t class**\r\n* it has a current pen and background color (pen_t) to save corresponding objects\r\n* it has width, height (int) to store dimension info\r\n* it has drawing (drawing_t) to save the drawing\r\n* it has twoDArray ( vector<vector<bool> >) to store boundary information\r\n* it clear, draw and save which clears objects list, calls draw function of drawing and calls print function of drawing\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**my_draw main file**\r\n* it has reshape function to update window size variables to get mouse position\r\n* it has display function to redraw image or draw only last object as required\r\n* key board and mouse call back functions\r\n+ Use c to load new canvas - then specify size and background color in terminal \r\n+ Use d to initialize new drawing Use 1 to switch on line mode - which on clicking two points will draw the line and 1 to switch of line mode \r\n+ Use 2 to switch on polygon mode - which on clicking will add points to polygon and 2 to draw polygon and for next polygon switch on polygon mode \r\n+ Use f to switch on fill mode - click to fill the bounded area \r\n+ Use c to change color of line and polygon when in fill mode you can choose check board and simple fill, which then will ask for respective colors Use u to undo last action \r\n+ Use l to load a image Use s to save image to images/saveImage file which should be copied so it is not replaced on next save \r\n+ Use esc to close\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Image of my room in myDraw**\r\n![Room Image](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~manku/Images/myDraw/room.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
